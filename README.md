# AIF-API
The API that connects the AIF frontend to hazard information and Ushahidi reports.

Built using https://github.com/thomaxxl/safrs 

I will add instructions how to set this up locally later.

Live demo: http://dpaulus.org:5000/

Currently supports:
* pushing, getting, updating and deleting JSON data into tables 'hazards' and ushahidi_reports'
